Part 1:   
a) You and your partners COSC id and PSID
cosc2991 1354098 Fabian Ornelas
cosc2992 1293866 Michael Panagos


Part 2:   
a) the make file will build everything then you run ./mypython <filename.py>
   
Part 3:
a) it can handle all basic math 
    it can handle all variable assignments a= f() is also valid
    prints strings expressions and both print("string",expressn)
    function are very bassic we couldnt figure out how to do indents  our function end with a return or a simple funtion that jsut does a print 
    we couldn't get if or else statments to work we couldn't figure out how to do the indetents and ran out of time 
    

Part 4:
a) we used flex to create our regular expression and make the token. then we use bison to create our our syntex order and pasrse them 
right now all we could get to really work is that if there is a funciton call and a fucntion return it will store that in a node and when the function is called then the val is returned 
we were trying to get indents down but we couldnt figure out how to do it and that hurt our if statement and functions
